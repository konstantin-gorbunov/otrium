Description:

This test application is a "request to talk".

Please do not think that it is an ideal, scalable, fully covered enterprise solution.

There are plenty of things that can be improved, for example:

- architecture;
- test coverage and type of testing;
- documentation;
- localization; 
- RTL support;
- CI/CD configs;
- code style and naming;
- UX/UI;
- refactoring of the whole project.

I hope all those will not afraid you and you find a time to talk with me about my solution.

Sincerely, KM Gorbunov.
