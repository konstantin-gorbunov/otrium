# Otrium
Otrium iOS Challenge

Develop a GitHub user profile screen based on the design we provide. 
The user data should be fetched using the official GitHub GraphQL API.

The screen should display main user information (image, name, login, email, followers, following), 3 first of pinned repositories, 10 first of top and starred repositories.

You can display your own or any other user profile.

Navigation to other screens or any action on clicking by something isn't required. 

Implementation of GitHub OAuth flow isn't required.

Time to complete 1 day but we will be glad to consider any results that you manage to provide during this time.
